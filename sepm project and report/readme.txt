*********************Explanation about the project******************************



We have used Convolutional Neural Network which is a Deep Learning algorithm  to train the images to assign importance like learnable weights and biases 
to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.

 

STEPS:-

1. Install python on your system. The implementation of Food Classification is done using keras therefore, we need to import the libraries required by the application.

2. Save project folder in any path.

3. Open the terminal and change directory (cd) to project path.

4. Run test.py file using command (python test.py)

5. Enter the image path and hence the result will be predicted.The Dataset is located in folder named images which consists of two classes apple, baby_back_ribs. 


Example:- If it is the image of apple then the output will be displayed as

   OUTPUT**** {{{{{{{           Prediction: apple [[0.4981355]]         }}}}}}}}}
